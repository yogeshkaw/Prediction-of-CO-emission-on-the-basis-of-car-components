# Prediction-of-CO-emission-on-the-basis-of-cars-components

Main aim of this project to predict CO emission from the given 
data which is related to car models and their CO emission. In 
order to predict CO emission we need 13 feature for more details 
run our project. This project will help us to reduce  CO level 
or to control CO level in our atmosphere. As this Machine Learning 
model predict CO emission from  the component of engine , 
transmission, transmission type, fuel etc. By using this model 
we can predict CO emission in earlier stage of car development 
with 90% accuracy on unseen data. This  model will help car 
manufacture to gain information regarding their car without 
running several test which will reduce cost of designing as 
well as R&D. This web application can be also used by National 
Govt. to make sure no car manufacture is using engine with high 
level of CO emission . Govt. can use this application to predict 
the CO emission of different car and after that they can cross 
check this by surprise inspection.
